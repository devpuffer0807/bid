---------Commercial MERN--------------------
⭐⭐Hi⭐⭐
Congrats on starting a special website for your business.
Reading through your job description carefully, I am reaching out to you with a great interest in your project.
I've made several websites from scratch for my former clients and all of them were very happy about my work and their value so I am proud of my rich first-hand practical experience gained through my career.
You can check some of them here.

https://www.autorentals.com/
https://invest.cardonecapital.com/

In technical aspect, I would like to use ReactJs as a frontend framework and Nodejs as a backend.
As you required completely serverless using Firebase so it is #1 important to familiar with Firebase cloud service for you.
And this is what gives me an edge over the others since I've developed 10+ websites using  Firebase.

According to your basic requirements, I will use following Firebase services.
1, 3, 4, 5: Firebase Console, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Functions
2: Firestore
7: Firebase Cloud Messaging.
One of the firebase app I'v developed is
https://officestock.ca/

If you like it, please contact me and let's discuss about how we can build successful ecommerce website in more detail.

Look forward to your kind response and let's start building something cool.
Thanks.

------Angular + TypeScript-----------
Hello.
I am senior Angular/Typescript developer with 6 years of experience in building web applications.
I am confident with my skills and as you required, I am ready to have a test for free in a few days.
In the test, you can also check my talents in HTML, CSS.
If you'd be able to contact me so that I can message you after the test, that'd be great.
Thanks.

---No stech only goal------
Hi.
Congrats on building your own udemy like website.
As a senior web developer with rich experience in building web applications, I am reaching out to you with a great interest in NoraHome Development.
I've made several websites similar to this one so I have couple of ideas to make it better.

Please check this website which I've participated in development.
https://frontendmasters.com/

I believe you will like it a lot.
Regarding responsive and UI & UX, that doesn't matter for me at all.
I will integrate mobile payment system as you need.
If you'd able to contact me at your convenient time, that'd be great.
Thanks.
-----------MEVN-socketio----------
Hello.
I have done similar projects before using Socket.io and Node.js so I am very confident that I can absolutely do this.
You can check this blockchain website, one of my past work which used Socket.io heavily.
https://dappradar.com/
There might be several issues but one of most common issue is disconnecting socket clients properly and clearly to ensure no lingering sockets.
If you'd be able to provide more details via DM, that'd be great.
Let's start fixing and make it cool ASAP.
Thanks.

-----MERN Discord/auth/paypal--------
Hi.
Congrats on building Discord Dashboard with paypal subscription.
As a senior web developer, I am reaching out to you with a great interest in this great project development.
After fully checking your description, I've got your main idea.
Three main logics here are 
1) user side / subscription to Discord account from Paypal or cancel it, 
2) user side / allow paying users to get invited to server by clicking a button
3) admin side / detecting user info
4) admin side / auto kicking users with subscription ends

Given your job description, it is more about backend with integrating social apis and this is where my talents could be better used.
In the last 3 years, I have developed many websites and most of them heavily used Paypal, Discord, Facebook, Google etc so I am extremely familiar with these api integrations.
If you'd be able to contact me via DM, it'd great.
Regards.


-------Front-end redisgn---------
Hello
Congrats on starting new web-based application for your business and I am reaching out to you with a great interest in the rewriting of Front-end.
I have carefully checked Web App Specs and fully understand the goal of this job.

You can check some of my past work here.
https://www.tradingview.com/
https://invest.cardonecapital.com/
https://www.bowsy.com/

Also check one of the world's most-loved theme React Material.
https://material-ui.com/store/previews/bamburgh-react-admin-dashboard-pro/

As a senior front-end developer, I have rich experience in building web applications so I would bring a lot of great ideas to the table for you.
You can discuss with me what great parts we can use from other websites including eztexting.com, simpletexting.com or whatever you like.

I think recreating the frontend wouldn't take much time (maybe less than 15 days, still I am not 100% sure unless checking your website fully).
If you'd be able to contact me with some more helpful details, that'd be amazing!

Regrads.
Valdislav.

And finally, it seems like it also needs an admin dashboard where admin users can control data needed for the game.
If you agree, I will made it using admin template whatever you like.

Hello, I've carefully checked the ChangeRequests pdf file and 3 attached screenshots.
I am a senior React.js developer and I have rich experience in building websites so I have full confidence with my talents.

Based on your doc file, I have a few questions for you.
1) FN-205
- Does the backend use SQL or NoSQL?
- What query Language does the website use? REST or GraphQL
2) FN-191
3) FN-199
- It seems that it needs some small works in Backend Side.
  Is it going to be my responsiblity or have you got another backend developer?

I can start work right now and I do not think it will take more than 3 days and 150 USD.

Hello, I've read your job description thoroughly and I have several questions and my suggestions for you.

1: What web frameworks are you going to use?
   My suggestion is 
	1) use Node/Express + Socket.io since it is known as the best choice for real time communication
	2) use React or Vue because it guarantees best speed even though website renders frequently because of real time messages and 
2: Do you have any designs for the development?
3: You mentioned about camera but not clear if you want video chat functionality or just broadcasting video file is ok.
   My suggestion is
	if you want to have broadcasting functionality implemented, I have special thing to bring to the table, that is observable pattern which is the perfect match for this purpose.


My plan
0. Starting phase - 100 usd
1. Users Module
	1) Broadcaster - 200usd
		- Opening Room and managing functionality
		- Broadcasting video
	2) Viewer - 200usd
		- Joining Room and watch video
		- Gifting credits
	3) Membership - 100 usd
2. Admin Panel Module
	1) Open or Ban Broadcaster/Viewer account - 100 usd
	2) Ban private Rooms - 100 usd
	3) Credit Control - 100 usd
	4) Themeify admin panel including notification customization - 100 usd
3. Payment and Email module - 200 usd

So in total, it is going to be 1.2k and I can complete task in 45 days.
If it sounds reasonable for you, please don't hesitate to contact me via private chat with the answers.

Hello, I am a Senior Larvel+Vue stack Developer who has 3+ years of experience.
I've read your job description and checked MP4 file and I think I can give you a pleasure.

I have strong strong skills and rich experience with Laravel + Vue full-stack development.
And I mastered PHP, JavaScript, SQL, CSS/LESS/SCSS and especially good at solving security concerns including SQL injection attacks, XSS and CSRF.
I also have got rich practical experience with integrating many 3rd party plugins including Mailing and Payment modules as well as AWS deployment.
And my experience with boosting performance of websites could be the special thing that I can bring to the table.

I have done several projects that are similiar to this one before.
Based on your MP4 file, I think you used Google Material UI's design and that's what I am especially good at.
I can provide you fully responsive and nice looking user interfaces in a short period of time by leveraging my talents with Vue Material.

You will be happy with quality of my code and fast delivery.
I'm flexible in working hours and full time available, I can overlap at least 8 hrs a day in your timezone.

Hello, I have rich experience in boosting performance of JavaScript written websites.
Most of the time, the crucial reason was rerendering of the whole UI rather than just a specific part that needs to be updated.
And I wonder if your website uses enough lazy-loading feature which reduces the inital loading time dramatically.
I am ready to switch your website to React.js framework which guarantees the modularity and high performance.
I am also familiar with Webpack.
Looking forward to hearing from you with more details.
Thank you.
