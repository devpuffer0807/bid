Hello.
Being a senior Nft developer, I am reaching out to you with my interest in your project.
✔️ Why me:
   In fact, I am a blockchain&NFT expert and well-versed in famous Defi-projects like Uniswap, ERC20 and ERC721 Tokens, Blockchain Supply Chain Solutions, and many more things.

This is my working history with NFT

My another project is NFT minting site on Ethereum mainnet.
First I made 10k images and metadata and then using IPFS API, I have uploaded all assets to IPFS storage.
You can see in my profile, I have rich experience in solidity and web3.js too.
Using ERC721 token and solidity, I have developed a smart contract for the NFT minting site on the Ethereum mainnet.
I added mint function(mint NFT token), wallet of owner function(decide the token owner), token URI(set base URI), set cost(only owner) and so on.
Using remix and truffle, I have developed smart contract to ethereum mainnet.

My latest project is the NFT minting site and I have developed that site from scratch.
First I prepared layers for images such as background, face, hair, beards, glasses.
After that using node.js and layers, I have developed a random generating engine and metadata for 10k NFTs.
Also using metaplex command, I uploaded 10 images and metadata files to arweave.net storage.
And then I have completed smart contract with Rust and deployed it to solana network using metaplex. Currently, preferred programming language for the smart contract is Rust. I have developed many smart contract with rust and anchor frameworks on the Solana network.

I am ready to start and looking forward to meeting you soon for a start
Best regards
