Hi respected client!
Nice to meet you!
As a senior blockchain&NFT developer, I have already been involved in many innovative NFT projects(ERC721/1155 Contract, Mint WebSite, NFT Market Place) that are technically flawless.
So no problem with satisfying your requirement seamlessly.

I solved the points like the following in these projects

-upload arts to IPFS and get metadata, tokenURI
-create ERC721 smart contract for NFT
-create a website for mint NFT and show minted NFT
-wallet connection(metamask, binance wallet, wallet connect and trust wallet) and web3 integration with web3.js and ether.js
-frontend development by React/Web3

So I can even deploy your project on testnet in which you don't have to pay for gas fees and then if you are satisfied, you can safely deploy it on Mainnet.

I will do my best for you to provide High Quality and High Speed.

Best Regards
