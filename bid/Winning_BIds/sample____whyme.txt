Our tentative proposal includes:

1. We will start developing home page layouts with 02 Design concepts to choose from. The concepts are open to revisions until you approve.

2. Once the home page design is approved, we will provide you with inner pages designs that are open to revisions until you are satisfied.

3. Integration of homepage and inner pages with CMS structure and setting up links to easily manage your website from the backend.

4. The website will be responsive in nature for compatibility to Desktops/mobile/tablets and speed optimized as per Google Page Speed parameters

Thank you for the taking time to read my application. I'm looking forward to having a detailed discussion about the project in detail.

Thanks & regards
